abstract = {We propose a semiparametric method for estimating spectral densities of isotropic Gaussian processes with scattered data. The spectral density function (Fourier transform of the covariance function) is modeled as a linear combination of B-splines up to a cutoff frequency and, from this point, a truncated algebraic tail. We calculate an analytic expression for the covariance function and tackle several numerical issues that arise when calculating the likelihood. The parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood using the simulated annealing method. Our method directly estimates the tail behavior of the spectral density, which has the greatest impact on interpolation properties. The use of the likelihood in parameter estimation takes the correlations between observations fully into account. We compare our method with a kernel method proposed by Hall et al. and a parametric method using the Mat{\'{e}}rn model. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the other two by several criteria. Applicatio...},

@book{Stein1999,
abstract = {Prediction of a random field based on observations of the random field at some set of locations arises in mining, hydrology, atmospheric sciences, and geography. Kriging, a prediction scheme defined as any prediction scheme that minimizes mean squared prediction error among some class of predictors under a particular model for the field, is commonly used in all these areas of prediction. This book summarizes past work and describes new approaches to thinking about kriging.},

abstract = {When analyzing functional neuroimaging data, it is particularly important to consider the spatial structure of the brain. Some researchers have applied geostatistical methods in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to enhance the detection of activated brain regions. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric variogram model for the complicated spatial characteristics of fMRI data. The new periodic variogram model can well describe the fluctuating spatial structure of fMRI data, considering both the nonlinear physical relationship between the proximate voxels and the functional relationship between distant voxels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new variogram model using fMRI data from a saccade study.},

abstract = {The effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes on the properties of P3HT:PCBM based solar cells has been studied. The concentration of MWCNT was optimized at 0.2{\%} and the concentration of P3HT:PCBM was increased from 20mg/ml to 30mg/ml to obtain highest efficiency. An increase in charge carrier mobility was also observed, which is attributed to high charge transport properties of MWCNT. The active layer was optically stable with respect to absorption, whereas the emission spectra revealed an increase in charge recombination with time. The solar cells doped with MWCNT exhibited increased stability as compared to undoped cells.},
