Title: GPU-Accelerated Monte Carlo Estimation of a Gaussian Process Covariance Matrix
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person('John', 'Ensley', email = 'johnensley17@gmail.com', role = c('aut', 'cre'))
Description: This package is a wrapper around a single function, mc(). This function 
    takes a vector of observations from a Gaussian process and a vector of random samples
    from a spectral density and estimates the covariance matrix between the observations. 
    The covariance matrix is estimated elementwise, and can be pretty large, so the operation
    is sped up with parallel computing on a GPU. You must have a CUDA-enabled GPU on your
    machine to install this package!
